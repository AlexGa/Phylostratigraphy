Phylostratigraphy
=================

####Pipeline for phylostratigraphic analysis.####


Phylostratigraphy was introduced by Domazet-Lo&scaron;o et al. in 2007. The aim of this procedure is to group genes by their phylogenetic origin to uncover footprints of impotant adaptive events in evolution.
It is a statistical approach to reconstruct macroevolutionary trends based on the assumption of punctuated emergence of protein families.
