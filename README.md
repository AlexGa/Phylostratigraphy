Phylostratigraphy
=================

Pipeline for phylostratigraphic analysis.
-----------------------------------------

Phylostratigraphy was introduced by Domazet-Loso et al. in 2007. The aim of this procedure is to group genes by their phylogenetic origin to uncover footprints of impotant adaptive events in evolution.
It is a statistical approach to reconstruct macroevolutionary trends based on the assumption of punctuated emergencce of protein families.
